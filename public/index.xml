      <description>What Is Walk On Play At Area 51 Paintball? Walk on play is also known as general admission, reacreational, or open play. Players will usually arrive without a scheduled appointment and play with others that have just arrived as well. A walk on player can also be someone who is not part of a pre-paid private event or scheduled event.&#xA;We occasionally offer walk-on play, also known as open play, on Saturday mornings and afternoons when we do not have scheduled events.</description>

It also helps break down barriers between staff members, who may have previously been strangers. Cooperation, communication, and strategy are all key ingredients to the game that can be translated into decision-making in the workplace.&#xA;What is paintball and why does it work for team building? Paintball is a team-competitive sport where players shoot each other with paint filled capsules.</description>
