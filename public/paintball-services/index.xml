Players will usually arrive without a scheduled appointment and play with others that have just arrived as well.  A &lt;strong&gt;walk on&lt;/strong&gt; player can also be someone who is not part of a pre-paid private event or scheduled event.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We occasionally offer walk-on play, also known as open play, on Saturday mornings and afternoons when we do not have scheduled events.  There is typically a better chance for larger numbers of people to play at this time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Paintball is great for team building because it allows the players to work together as a cohesive unit to achieve a goal. It also helps break down barriers between staff members, who may have previously been strangers. Cooperation, communication, and strategy are all key ingredients to the game that can be translated into decision-making in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-paintball-and-why-does-it-work-for-team-building&#34;&gt;What is paintball and why does it work for team building?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paintball is a team-competitive sport where players shoot each other with paint filled capsules. This is great for team building because it requires team work, critical thinking, and communication. Teams are often comprised of 5 or more players, who must communicate with each other to strategize the best way to win the game. The goal of the game is to eliminate all opposing players from play by spraying them with paint from a gun that shoots capsules filled with water-soluble dye.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Although paintball markers come in many different shapes and sizes, the most common type is a semi-automatic marker.  There are many benefits to owning a paintball marker, such as the fun of personalizing your own device and shooting your friends with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
