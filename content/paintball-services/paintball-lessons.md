Paintball is a game in which players are divided into teams of 5 or 12, with the goal of causing the other team to "out" (reach a pre-defined number of points), or eliminating all members of that team by tagging them with paintballs. Players use their paintball guns to mark opponents and shoot them with paintballs, wearing protective gear such as masks, goggles, and body armor. There are different variations on the rules for recreational play.


## Paintball is a super fun and competitive sport 

What is paintball? Paintball is a competitive sport that has grown in popularity over the years. It is very similar to laser tag but the guns are not lasers, they are paint-filled pellets. The game starts with an "opposing team" off in one corner of the playing field and the "home team" set up across from them in another corner. The opposing team sends "paintballs" over to the home team's half of the field by shooting them. The goal of paintball is usually to mark all of your opponents with paint in which case you win the round.  However, if a player can remain hidden from their opponent for an extended period then they will score points or even gain an advantage over the game.  


## What equipment to prepare: Paintballs, paintball gun, eye protection, gloves 

Paintball is a popular recreational sport that individuals and groups alike enjoy playing. For those who wish to play paintball, it is imperative to prepare for the game. There are many items that should be prepared before you head out to play: paintballs, a paintball gun, eye protection and gloves. Equipment should be checked and repaired as needed before any game play. Many of our players want to learn more about maintaining, preparing, and checking their equipment.  Area 51 Paintball offers workshops and lessons to teach participants the basics of equipment preparation and care.  We are currently seeking additional sponsors for these classes as well as instructors who can provide a different teaching style than we've been able to find in the past.



## Paintball: How to use your paintball marker and shoot your opponent 

Paintball is a popular sport where two teams, armed with paintball markers and paintballs, compete.  Each side has a large area in which to aim at each otherâ€™s position. In some cases, this may take place on a course designed specifically for the event. Either way, most games have a specified amount of time allotted before the game ends. 


Paintball markers have a variety of safety features to ensure they are safe to use. Our lessons will help you learn about the many features your paintball marker can have, how to maintain them, and how to use them on the field.  We also go over the etiquette of paintball and how to ensure that all the players stay safe and avoid injury.  


## Safety: Equip yourself with the proper gear and common sense 

Paintball is a sport combining strategy and action. From starting position to aiming skill, side-to-side movement and ducking for cover, paintball is an intense game that relies on the player's ability to follow direction and react quickly. To be prepared to play paintball, one needs all the proper equipment: a paintball gun, several ammunition pods, protective gear such as elbow and knee pads and a helmet. Our lessons will teach you about what type of safety equipment is the best and how to take care of it so it has a long lifetime service for you.  Not all paintball equipment is created equal.  We will help you identify features of safety equipment and gear that will help you be a better paintball player and have more fun on the field.  


## Conclusion: Paintball is a fun and safe sport if you're prepared
