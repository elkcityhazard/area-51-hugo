**Walk on play** is also known as general admission, reacreational, or open play. Players will usually arrive without a scheduled appointment and play with others that have just arrived as well.  A **walk on** player can also be someone who is not part of a pre-paid private event or scheduled event.  

We occasionally offer walk-on play, also known as open play, on Saturday mornings and afternoons when we do not have scheduled events.  There is typically a better chance for larger numbers of people to play at this time.  

Be sure to check our website, holiday schedule, or call to learn more about walk-on times.  

## How Much Do Walk On Days Cost? 

Prices for walk on play is typically start at **$50 dollars** for the Area 51 Paintball full rental.

- A paintball mask
- A paintball marker
- A pod pack with 2 pods
- 500 rounds of paintballs

## What To Expect Of Walk-On Days?

Since there is no scheduling for walk on days, we cannot guarantee how many people will be participating.  This can mean that these events will vary from time to time depending on how many participants there are.  Thankfully, Area 51 Paintball is a diverse playing field that has many opportunities for creative gaming.  

Make sure that you pack plenty of water and snacks to keep your energy strong and your hydration adequate.  We recommend wearing clothes that are not too loose, but not too tight as well.  Generally speaking, anything you might wear outside to work around the house will most likely work for paintball.  You will be diving, jumping, running, and crawling so make sure you are wearing something that is adaptable.
