## Area 51 Paintball Equipment: The Best Paintball Gear For Your Money.


One of the best things about Area 51 Paintball is that they offer gear and equipment from a variety of brands. Whether you need tactical, rental or recreational paintball guns, Area 51 has it. So you are never too far from your next epic paintball game!  We make sure to only carry reputable brands that have been vetted by our players and professionals of the sport.  


## Gear and equipment


Our mission is to provide the best paintball equipment and gear for sale, as well as bringing a great experience to customers. Our goal is to give you unparalleled service to ensure your next paintball purchase is a memorable fun experience.   


We have specially designed paintball masks that are made of high quality material. The most popular paintball safety mask is the swat force full face. This mask has a foam lining that covers the eyes, nose and mouth to protect you from splatter and flying objects.  Not only does this mask protect you from harm, it has the added benefit of having superior visibility on the field.  This will be sure to give you an extra advantage!


## Selection Of Paintball Markers


Tippmann, Empire, Dye, Planet Eclipse: these are just a few of the paintball markers we carry.   


We have a variety of paintball markers that will be appropriate for new players as well as veteran paintballers. Our entry-level marker, the Tiberius Arms T9.1 is an excellent choice for younger players and those new to the sport. The semi-automatic firing mode allows you to squeeze off single shots or rapid fire without having to worry about controlling a rate of fire switch like on our other models. Our T16 is another good option for novice players as it features both a rubber and a sponge. The rubber is made of soft plastic which allows for better control over the ball, while the sponge is designed to give you more speed.  Tippmann 98 still offers a great value and performance ratio for the money and is an excellent choice for new or intermediate players on a budget.  


Not sure which paintball marker you should purchase?  No worries!  We are happy to help you choose the paintball marker that is right for you and explain the features and added benefits of each paintball marker.
