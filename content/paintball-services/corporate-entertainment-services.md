Paintball is great for team building because it allows the players to work together as a cohesive unit to achieve a goal. It also helps break down barriers between staff members, who may have previously been strangers. Cooperation, communication, and strategy are all key ingredients to the game that can be translated into decision-making in the workplace.

## What is paintball and why does it work for team building? 
 

Paintball is a team-competitive sport where players shoot each other with paint filled capsules. This is great for team building because it requires team work, critical thinking, and communication. Teams are often comprised of 5 or more players, who must communicate with each other to strategize the best way to win the game. The goal of the game is to eliminate all opposing players from play by spraying them with paint from a gun that shoots capsules filled with water-soluble dye.


## Some Of The Challenges Of Building A Strong Corporate Team


### Managing a diverse workforce


Cultural diversity plays an important role when managing a diverse corporate team. Each employee has their own unique cultural background and this could potentially conflict with the culture of others on your team. Cultural differences create challenges such as those relating to teamwork and time management. 

### Focusing on individual strengths instead of weaknesses


When collaborating with other people, people focus on their strengths and overlook their weaknesses. People tend to think about themselves first before focusing on the needs of others. When working as part of a team, everyone's strengths should help contribute towards achieving one common goal by providing valuable resources. 


### Encouraging open communication and discussion


Open communication and discussion are two crucial elements within a strong corporate team. Discussion allows members of the team to share ideas and opinions without fear of judgement. These discussions not only strengthen relationships between teammates but also helps teams avoid conflicts before they arise.  Paintball requires open communication and discussion because your team will need to work together to develop a strategy to beat the opposing team.  

### Identifying the best talent


Paintball can be difficult for some individuals due to its physical nature. Some employees may lack self confidence or have physical disabilities so they cannot easily participate in activities such as playing sports, running around, climbing etc. Nevertheless, you may be surprised who rises to the occasion.  Corporate Paintball Events can help you see who the real leaders on year team are.  

### Ensuring employees are happy and engaged


An employee that is unhappy may negatively affect the rest of the company team. Employees that aren't happy may struggle to perform well at work and frustrate other employees. 

### Working to build trust


 Trust is an intangible factor which employees often feel lonely when building it up with their colleagues. Trust plays an important role in any relationship whether it be business, personal or romantic. Employee loyalty is something that you must strive to cultivate.
