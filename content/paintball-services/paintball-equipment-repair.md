Safety gear is a must when engaging in a physical activity such as paintball. Paintball equipment may be damaged from being dropped, running over by vehicle, or coming into contact with solid objects. The following tips will show you the best ways to fix your paintball equipment and get back on the field.


## What is paintball equipment and what does it need to be repaired and maintained


Paintball markers are essential to playing paint ball. Paintball markers use CO2 cartridges to shoot balls of paint at other players. Although paintball markers come in many different shapes and sizes, the most common type is a semi-automatic marker.  There are many benefits to owning a paintball marker, such as the fun of personalizing your own device and shooting your friends with it.


Paintball markers, paintball masks, and other safety equipment are all things we can help you out with if you are in need of repair.  


 
## How to maintain paintball guns and how often they should be maintained



There are 4 main categories of maintenance for paintballs: filling up gas tanks; changing barrels; cleaning components; and lubricating pneumatics. All these aspects of the maintenance process require special tools, but if you do not have them there are alternatives that can be used instead. 


Paintball markers come in many shapes and sizes. The most popular style is the semi-automatic paintball marker that uses a CO2 or compressed air tanks to propel the paintballs. When using CO2, the gas is carried in a 6,000 to 10,000 psi bottle with a regulator to adjust the pressure for different markers. A 12 oz canister of compressed air will power an average pump for about six hundred shots.  


If the paintball gun has a defective paintball mechanism, the risk of injury is increased.


## Paintball mask maintenance: how to maintain masks and how often they should be maintained?



A properly functioning paintball mask helps prevent eye injury and protects against inhalation damage from the chemical propellant present in paintball ammunition. Regularly cleaning your mask will keep it running efficiently and protect you from getting injured by accident.

## Paintball barrel maintenance: what type of barrels are available and how often they should be cleaned?


The basic function of any paintball marker's barrel is to fire the paintballs at a target at high speed. If the paintball marker does not shoot accurately, its barrel may need replacement. There are two types of paintball marker barrels - open topped and closed topped. These components can get dirty, jammed up, and clogged which makes playing paintball difficult.  Having a clogged paintball barrel is like having a clogged gun barrel. In both cases, the gun cannot fire as quickly or as accurately.  


Area 51 can help you maintain your paintball marker barrel to ensure that it is throwing paint smoothly and efficiently and only at your intended target.
