Although there are many similarities between indoor and outdoor paintball fields, the differences outweigh them. For one thing, an outdoor paintball field is obviously outdoors and therefore has greater visibility. The playing area on an outdoor field can be natural or it can be constructed by adding bunkers with artificial cover. It also makes use of natural terrain features such as hills and mud pits to add realism to the game.  Indoor fields and centers are great for those who want a very consistent experience each time since weather and the seasons do not factor into the game as much.
