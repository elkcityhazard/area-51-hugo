  content: Paintball is a sport that is played like real combat. Your physical fitness,
    stamina, and endurance are tested. The game is also great for sharpening your
    analytical and tactical skills. A playerâ€™s overall fitness plays an important
    role in his performance during the game. A player who is fit and has stamina can
    stay longer in the field and engage in more tactical moves and strategies. As
    paintball involves running, dodging, crawling, and shooting, it definitely helps
    improve overall fitness of a person. Paintball uses teamwork bringing out the
    best in players. Paintball is a game which requires maximum mental concentration
    and an ability to be adaptable. It is a game that helps you stay healthy, as it
    is a fantastic cardio exercise. It will also improve your analytical and tactical
    skills in life, as it is a game of strategy. Not only does paintball help you
    stay fit, but it develops your leadership skills. It also helps you relax after

  content: "The modern game of paintball began in 1981 as a training exercise for
    military forces. It soon became popular with civilians, however, and is now played
    by millions of people around the world each year. \n\nPaintball has been called
    one of the safest sports on Earth, but safety precautions are always necessary
    when playing. \n\nIs paintball a safe sport to play?  Paintball injuries are rare
    and we provide all of the safety equipment you need.   We believe that paintball
    is one of the safest sports on earth. In fact, it's probably safer than many more
    popular sports. \n\nFor example, you're less likely to be injured playing paintball
    than football or ice hockey. Paintball is a very safe sport because most injuries
    are due to mistakes in how the game is played. \n\nThis means that most injuries
    can be prevented by following proper safety precautions. Your safety gear is an
    important way to prevent injuries while you play. \n\nPaintball masks and chest
    protectors are designed and tested to give you the best protection available while
    still allowing you to safely play the game."

  content: Although there are many similarities between indoor and outdoor paintball
    fields, the differences outweigh them. For one thing, an outdoor paintball field
    is obviously outdoors and therefore has greater visibility. The playing area on
    an outdoor field can be natural or it can be constructed by adding bunkers with
    artificial cover. It also makes use of natural terrain features such as hills
    and mud pits to add realism to the game.  Indoor fields and centers are great
    for those who want a very consistent experience each time since weather and the
    seasons do not factor into the game as much.
